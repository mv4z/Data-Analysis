# Data-Analysis
Data Analysis work done through courses taken at DePaul, or personal projects. 

## 324 R Scripts
R Scripts written while learning different types of regression techniques, for homework assignments, and one from my final project for DSC 324 Advanced Data Analysis

## 341 R Scripts
R scripts written while learning new packages in R such as dplyr, mice, ggplot, and more (for DSC 341 Foundations of Data Science)

## Hadoop
Code written for DSC 555 Mining Big Data. This course served as an introduction to Hadoop Distributed File System, Hive, Pig, and working with Amazon Web Services. I'd say that one of my favorite things to do was write my own implementation of Map Reduce code using Python. Since it finally clicked to me how versatile programming really is, using it to manipulate data is something that I do whenever I'm able to.
